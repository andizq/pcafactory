The PCAFACTORY package seeks to facilitate the extraction of turbulent properties from (M)HD simulations of molecular cloud complexes. To do so, the PCAFACTORY collects features from TurbuStat, sf3dmodels, astrodendro and LIME to derive pseudo-structure functions from syntehtic observations using principal component analysis. 

The PCAFACTORY package is presented in the Paper II of the Cloud Factory's series. Please refer to that work if this package was useful for your research.

(Include bibtex when available).
