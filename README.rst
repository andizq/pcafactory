The PCAFACTORY package makes easier the extraction of turbulent properties from (M)HD simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM). To do so, the PCAFACTORY collects features from TurbuStat, sf3dmodels, astrodendro and LIME in order to retrieve pseudo-structure functions from synthetic observations using principal component analysis. 

The PCAFACTORY package is presented in the Paper II of the Cloud Factory's series. Please refer to that work if this package was useful for your research.

(Include bibtex when available).
